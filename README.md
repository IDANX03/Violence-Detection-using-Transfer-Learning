# ðŸŽ¯ Overview
This project implements a violence detection system that uses transfer learning with pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The algorithm analyses video frames and classifies them as violent or non-violent. By utilising transfer learning, the project achieves high accuracy while reducing training time and computational requirements.
